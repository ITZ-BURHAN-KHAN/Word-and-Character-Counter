# Word-and-Character-Counter
A Word and Character Counter is a JavaScript project that allows users to quickly and easily count the number of words and characters in a given piece of text. This type of tool is often used by writers and editors to track the length of their work, or by social media users to ensure that their posts meet platform guidelines.
